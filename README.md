scrnIO
======

A Python module that provides real-time screen output and terminal input, built around the 'curses' module.
Low-level functions are available for diplaying text with color and terminal attributes, and high-level
objects support intutive input and dynamic display of data. It is purpose built with a focus on real-time
processing and ease of use.

Great for robotics and other projects that need realtime feedback and input adjustment from within the
console environment.

In an early stage of development, but already a useful tool.  Next set of enhancements targeting range and
error checking, adding additional controls, such as timers and input boxes.  Also looking into adding trigger
events for the controls.
