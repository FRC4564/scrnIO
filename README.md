scrnIO
======

A Python module that provides realtime screen output and terminal input, based on the curses module.
Low-level functions are available for diplaying text with color and terminal attributes, and high-level
objects support intutive input and display of data.  Functionality is built with a focus on realtime processing
with simple, yet flexibile controls.

Great for robotics and other projects that need realtime feedback and input adjustment from within the
console environment.

In an early stage of development, but already a useful tool.  Next set of enhancements targeting more controls,
control display options and timing.  Also looking into adding trigger events for the controls.
