scrnIO
======

A Python module that provides realtime screen output and terminal input, based on the curses module.
Low-level functions are available for diplaying text with color and terminal attributes, and high-level
objects support intutive input and display of data.  Functionality is built with a focus on realtime processing
with simple, yet flexibile controls.

Great for robotics and other projects that need realtime feedback and input adjustment from within the
console environment.
